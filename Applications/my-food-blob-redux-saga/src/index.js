Hot module replacement (HMR). Using the webpack-dev-server we can set up hot module replacement with React.
This means whenever we modify a component and save the file webpack will replace the module on the page without reloading, 
and without losing component state

if  component  has changes , replace the module on the page without reloading & resetting its state
